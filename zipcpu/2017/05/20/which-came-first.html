    <p>When working on the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a>, the peripherals
came first.  <em>Only</em> when the peripherals were known to work did I transition to
building the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a>.</p>

<p>Does the order matter?  I think it does.  Someone else tried to build a CPU
first before building all of his peripherals–in this case, the memory
peripheral was the problem.
The result
<a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com/topic/3298-psram-chip-baked-or-am-i-just-high/">wasn’t pretty</a>.
While it hasn’t quite killed his project, he did run out of his startup dollars and had to put the project on the backburner. <a href="https://kestrelcomputer.github.io/kestrel/2017/03/07/kestrel-winter">[1]</a></p>

<p>If you want to build a CPU, I recommend building in this order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Build the debugging scaffolding.  The first thing you will need is an
interface to your FPGA that you can rely upon, one that will also allow you
to test the peripheral components found within your FPGA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using your scaffolding, build some peripherals.  Test them.  Get to know
them.  Get familiar with them.  Understand how many clocks they will take to
respond to a request.  Understand how to aggregate those peripherals
together so you can debug them all.</p>

    <p>I personally hang all of my peripherals off of a
<a href="http://opencores.org/opencores,wishbone">Wishbone</a>
<a href="https://opencores.org/cdn/downloads/wbspec_b4.pdf">B4 bus</a>,
although other busses exist which can be used for this purpose.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only once you know that your scaffolding and peripherals work, should you
then start on trying to place your CPU within your FPGA.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, this is all my own personal and humble opinions.  On the other hand,
the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">ZipCPU</a> already runs on several platforms.</p>
