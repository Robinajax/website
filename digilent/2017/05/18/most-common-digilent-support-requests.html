  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve been watching the <a href="https://forum.digientinc.com">Digilent Forum’s</a>, and
I’ve now seen some very common requests for FPGA help that keep coming back
over and over again.  I’ll separate these into three groups, and share them
here with you.  They are actual hardware problems, beginner problems, and
Vivado problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Actual Hardware Problems</li>
</ul>

<p>– Device not found.</p>

<p>User’s seem to have a problem getting their tools set up properly.
   I certainly did.
   One particular problem is basically, “I just plugged in my device and
   my computer doesn’t recognize it.”  This is commonly caused by an
   invalid or incomplete tool-suite setup.  However, it can be caused by a
   bad USB cable.  So, usually, if the device <em>was</em> working, it
   tends to be instead a bad USB cable.  Strangely enough, bad USB cables a
   rather common occurrence on the forums.</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong>: It depends on the problem</p>

<p>– There’s the FTDI request.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Many individuals have tried, either by accident or on purpose, reflashing
the FTDI interface chip on their board and, as a result, have broken their
board so badly that it no longer responds to configuration commands.  The
solution to this problem is that the Digilent staff will send this user a
private message with the correct software to reload onto their device.

The strange part of this request is that I am aware of one user who
has successfully reprogrammed the FT2232 chip on his board, and
achieved much higher data throughput as a result.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>The solution</strong>: The Digilent staff provides a private message containing
   instructions and/or data to fix this problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Beginner problems</li>
</ul>

<p>– I need to build (some instructor’s problem statement).  Please help me.</p>

<p>This request gets the least help from members on the forum.  The response
   is usually a kind pointer to where the user documentation is at and
   nothing more.</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong>:  The student needs to do his own homework.</p>

<p>– Help me, my design doesn’t work.</p>

<p>I’ll come back to this in a moment, but many students think that
   an experienced engineer can just deskcheck their work and find the bug.
   While I enjoy the challenge, and while I can often do this, it
   certainly wasn’t how I became an <em>experienced</em> engineer when working
   with FPGAs.  I got there through simulation to make sure my logic
   worked, and using a scope (or scopes) to make sure my simulation
   matched the device.</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong>: The solution is to simulate the design together with a
   simulated peripheral.  This is often how I find bugs in students serial
   port designs, for example.  I’ll connect their design to a <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32/blob/master/bench/cpp/uartsim.cpp">serial port
   simulator</a>,
   create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_change_dump">.vcd file</a> for
   viewing in <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net">gtkwave</a>, and write back about
   what I found.  There’s no reason why the student couldn’t have done this.</p>

<p>Perhaps I’ll post these results for the next student I help?</p>

<p>– Asynchronous Reset</p>

<p>While Xilinx devices support an asynchronous reset to the logic, it’s so
   unreliable that <a href="https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/PLD-Blog/That-Dangerous-Asynchronous-Reset/ba-p/12856">they recommend users not use it</a>.  This is usually a
   student’s first project on an actual FPGA, and a beginner’s mistake.</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong>: Get rid of the <em>negedge</em> <em>reset</em> from any always block
   dependencies.  Replace these with a combination of <em>initial</em> statements and
   (if necessary) synchronous resets.</p>

<p>– The logic Clock</p>

<p>Many new FPGA users aren’t quite aware the clocks are special things.
   They then create logic wires internal to their design which they wish
   to use to divide this clock rate.  While not a problem, such logic
   wires don’t have the reliability of a clock, and transitioning on their
   edges doesn’t produce the result you will want.  Where the problem comes
   into play is when the student wants their logic to transition on the
   positive (or worse negative) edge of this clock.</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong>: <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-function-of-a-strobe-function-in-digital-system">a logic strobe</a>.</p>

<p>This solution finds a lot of application in 1. beginning FPGA student
  designs, and then again in 2. signal processing designs, where the
  device’s clock speed is not synchronized to the FPGA’s clock, and hence
  the data comes in from the sensor at a slower speed than the devices
  clock speed.</p>

<p>– The student who hasn’t simulated their design</p>

<p>In this case, someone new to FPGA design has created some design and it
  doesn’t work.  They don’t know why.  This one is similar to the Vivado
  library component problem: they have no idea what’s going on internal
  to the FPGA to answer the “why won’t my program work” question.</p>

<p>The solution they want to this problem is not the industry solution.
  What these students want is for some kind soul on the forum to look at
  their code and tell them what they are doing wrong.</p>

<p><strong>The industry solution</strong> to this problem is to simulate the code and any
  peripherals it might be working with, and then as part of that to verify
  that the logic works as intended.</p>

<p>– They don’t know how to simulate their problem</p>

<p>Sometimes the user is trying to work with a piece of hardware they’ve
   never worked with before.  As a result, they have no simulation for this
   hardware because they just aren’t all that familiar with how it works.
   (A user button is a good example of this, since bouncing isn’t something
   most people place into simulators.) In this case, their design doesn’t work
   on the real hardware and, again, they don’t know why.</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong> to this problem is twofold.  First, build a simulator that
   encapsulates your understaning of the hardware from the diagrams and
   specifications you have.  Second, when that first part fails, use some
   form of a  scope to measure what is actually going on across the wires
   to/from the hardware.</p>

<p>– Crossing clock domains</p>

<p>Few students have ever heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability_in_electronics">metastability
   problems</a>.  As
   a result, they write code that crosses clock domains realizing that there
   might be a problem associated with doing so.</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong>: The simple solution is to clock every input at the new
   clock twice before using it.  This works for some things, though not all.
   A more complete discussion of how to deal with crossing from one clock
   can be found in <a href="http://www.sunburst-design.com/papers/CummingsSNUG2008Boston_CDC.pdf">this
   article</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vivado problems</li>
</ul>

<p>– The demo doesn’t build</p>

<p>Typically this is caused by the user trying to build the demo design
   using one version of Vivado, while the demo was instead built with
   another version of Vivado.</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong>: The Digilent staff share what version of Vivado was used
   to build the demo.  Sometimes the demo has gotten old, and the Digilent
   staff need to update it.</p>

<p>– They’ve integrated some component from the Vivado library into their design
  and “it’s not working”</p>

<p>Of all the times I’ve seen this problem, it has yet to be that the Xilinx
  provided IP component doesn’t work.  It’s more often that the user isn’t
  feeding the component properly, or using the results from the component
  properly.  Making the problem worse, rarely has the user taken the time to
  instrument what is going on, so they have no clue where their problem lies.</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong>: a good internal scope, such as the
  <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">wishbone scope</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope/blob/master/rtl/axi4lscope.v">AXI-Lite
  scope</a></p>

<p>– The user can’t figure out how to add custom IP to the Vivado flow</p>

<p><strong>The solution</strong>: Well, I might be biased here, but … my solution to
   this problem has been not to use the broken Vivado design flow.
   I’m sure I’ll discuss more of my problems with there processing flow as time
   goes on.</p>

<p>One of the pleasant things about the <a href="https://forum.digilentinc.com">Digilent
forums</a> is that these common requests are dealt
with in a friendly manner–even though I’m certain someone must be rolling their
eyes at seeing the same request <em>again</em>.</p>
