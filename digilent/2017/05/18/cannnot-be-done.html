<p>One common request on Digilent is the, “Can I do XYZ on board ABC”?</p>

<p>I really despise answering questions of this type.  I’ve been surprised too many
times by someone doing what I thought was impossible.  Indeed, I’ve also had my
own opportunities to surprise others by doing things they thought were
impossible.</p>

<p>A couple examples should illustrate this point:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I gave up early on the idea of building a Video game on a <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/">Basys-3
  board</a>.
  I figured the task was just plain impossible: although you can make
  a 128kB of block RAM on the board, there wasn’t enough memory on
  the board for a 640x480 piece of video memory, with a bare minimum of four
  bits per pixel (256kB required) and the Basys-3 <em>only</em> has the
  block RAM on board.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since giving up, I discovered some individuals had done it.  Digging into
  those who were willing to share, I learned how they had done it.  They took
  the video stream, and wrote characters directly on the stream using FPGA
  hardware.  That way, there was no storage requirement.  I had already done
  something similar to place a mouse on the screen, so I shouldn’t have been
  as surprised as I was.</p>

<ol>
  <li>When presenting at <a href="https://orconf.org/2016/">ORCONF</a> some time ago, I had
  the opportunity to meet my first Digilent employee.  When I shared with him
  what <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">I had done</a> with their
  <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/store.digilentinc.com/cmod-s6-breadboardable-spartan-6-fpga-module">CMod S6</a>, and specifically how I had managed
  to place a multi-tasking O/S (as I called it) on the board, he was
  exceptionally impressed.  Particularly since he had written off the board as
  being unfit for this type of task.</li>
</ol>
