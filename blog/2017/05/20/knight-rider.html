    <p>When I was a kid, I loved watching Knight Rider.  Once I picked up FPGA design,
I wanted to know how to make LED’s move and dim … just like 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxE2xWZNfOc">KITT’s lights</a> did.</p>

<p>If you are a beginner FPGA designer, this makes the perfect beginners project.</p>

<h2 id="walking-through-the-leds">Walking through the LEDs</h2>

<p>The first step requires simply walking through the LEDs.  This is a very
important step, as it demonstrates that all of your LEDs are properly set
up, properly connected, and that they will turn on when requested.</p>

<p>In our case, we’ll do this two different ways.  First, we’ll step the LED’s
once each second.  This way, there can be no question that the LED comes on
at the proper time.  Once that works, we can speed the process up, and make
a cool LED demo.</p>

<p>To step through the LED’s one at a time, you can use the following code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">`default_nettype none
`define	FASTWALKER
//
module	ledwalker(i_clk, o_led);
	input	wire		i_clk;
	output	reg	[7:0]	o_led;

	// Remember the clock testing code?  This is very similar, only it
	// creates a PPS signal once per second--every time the counter rolls
	// over.  You could create this signal ever half second, or every
	// quarter second, by just dropping the number of bits in the counter.
	reg	pps;
	reg	[31:0]	time_counter;
	always @(posedge i_clk)
		{ pps, time_counter } &lt;= time_counter + 32'd43;

	//
	// We then want to keep track of our state: which LED will be on
	//
	reg	[2:0]	led_posn;
	always @(posedge i_clk)
		if (pps)
			led_posn &lt;= led_posn + 1'b1;

	//
	// Now, we turn on the one LED on corresponding to the state we have
	// chosen.
	//
	always @(posedge i_clk)
	begin
		o_led[0] &lt;= (led_posn == 3'h0);
		o_led[1] &lt;= (led_posn == 3'h1);
		o_led[2] &lt;= (led_posn == 3'h2);
		o_led[3] &lt;= (led_posn == 3'h3);
		o_led[4] &lt;= (led_posn == 3'h4);
		o_led[5] &lt;= (led_posn == 3'h5);
		o_led[6] &lt;= (led_posn == 3'h6);
		o_led[7] &lt;= (led_posn == 3'h7);
	end

endmodule</code></pre></figure>

<p>If you don’t want to type this in, you can find my version of this example
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip/blob/master/rtl/pmodleds/ledwalker.v">here</a>.
You’ll need an <a href="http://icoboard.org">ICO board</a> and a <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-8ld-eight-high-brightness-leds/">PMod
LED8</a>
from <a href="http://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a> to
run it, although it’s almost generic enough to run on any FPGA board.  If you
don’t have that many LED’s?  Either don’t turn them all on, or adjust led_posn
to only cycle through the LED’s that you do have.</p>

<p>With a little work, I’m sure you could modify this example, so that the LED
that was ON walked from left to right, and then back from right to left.</p>

<h2 id="dimming-the-led">Dimming the LED</h2>

<p>The next thing you need to know, once you can turn each LED on individually,
is that you can “dim” an LED by turning it on
and off faster than an eye can see.  As you transition the LED from being more
often on to more often off, the LED will appear to dim.  As an example, try the
following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog">//
`default_nettype none
//
module dimmer(i_clk, o_led);
  input  wire i_clk;
  output wire o_led;

reg [26:0] counter;
always @(posedge i_clk)
  counter &lt;= counter + 1'b1;

always @(posedge i_clk)
  o_led &lt;= (counter[3:0] &lt; counter[26:23]);

endmodule</code></pre></figure>

<p>If you don’t want to type this in, you can find my version of this
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip/blob/master/rtl/basic/dimmer.v">here</a>,
written for the ICO Board.</p>

<h2 id="the-final-design">The final design</h2>

<p>You really don’t want me to give you the answer, now, do you?  Without giving
you a chance to do it yourself?  Try doing it yourself first.  Then, if you get
stuck or once you’ve achieved your goal, feel free to look at my solution
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/icozip/blob/master/rtl/pmodleds/ledbouncer.v">here</a>.
It’s a little more advanced than the ones above, in that it uses generic’s and
for loops within Verilog, but the concept remains the same.</p>

<p>One problem I had using the “High-brightness” LED’s on the 
<a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-8ld-eight-high-brightness-leds/">PMod LED8</a>,
was that it’s hard to see them actually “dim”.  As a result, the Knight
Rider effect is more substantial
on another board, such as the <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications">Nexys Video</a> or the <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/">Basys-3</a> from <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</a>,
since these use red LED’s that aren’t nearly as bright.</p>
