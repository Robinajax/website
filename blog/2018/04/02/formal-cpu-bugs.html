  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Today, I’m starting what will likely be the slow process of
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally verifying</a>
the <a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a>.  I’m going to use
<a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosy">yosys</a> for this process initially, but given
<a href="https://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest">SymbiYosys</a>’s ability to
run multiple formal configurations as separate tasks, I will probably need to
switch after I get some distance along.</p>

<p>At this point in the game, I’ve already <a href="/blog/2018/01/22/formal-progress.html">formally proven all of the
components</a>
of the <a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a>.
What remains is to prove the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/zipcpu.v">CPU itself</a>.</p>

<p>So here’s my question: How many bugs would you expect to find in a “working”
soft-core CPU?  One?  Ten?  Twenty?  One hundred?  Shall we count?  I propose
keeping a running log of the bugs I find in the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a> while using
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally methods</a>.
Perhaps this log will help to convince you the value of
<a href="/blog/2017/10/19/formal-intro.html">formally methods</a>,
perhaps not.  Either way, I’ll keep it accurate to the information I discover.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The memory manager refused to release the bus if the response came back
on the same cycle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certain errors should cause the CPU to halt–such as encountering a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)">bus</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error">error</a>
when reading from instruction memory.  Due to a (now locally fixed) bug
in the <a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a>, these errors
would not cause the CPU to halt if they were one of the first couple
instructions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a> is designed so that
memory reads or writes <em>never</em> need to be rolled back. This is to
facilitate using the memory bus for reading and
writing peripherals, such as the serial port.  Reads from such peripherals
have side effects that cannot be rolled back.  The formal methods however,
discovered an example where reading into the program counter, such as during
an indirect jump, my cause a following memory instruction to need to be
rolled back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a>’s current approach to
the compressed instruction set (CIS)
is to prevent the CPU from interrupting in the middle of a CIS instruction.
Formal methods, however, found an internal accounting bug which prevented
this logic from working properly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several bugs have been found in the debug infrastructure, allowing an
external debugger to change registers internal to the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a>.</p>

    <p>In one example, this was violating the rules the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a> uses when issuing
pipelined memory instructions.</p>

    <p>In another example, during a divide that was to write its results into <code class="highlighter-rouge">R0</code>,
the external debug infrastructure was allowed to write to a register,
say <code class="highlighter-rouge">R1</code>.  This would cause the divide to write its results into <code class="highlighter-rouge">R1</code> upon
completion, rather than <code class="highlighter-rouge">R0</code>.</p>

    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a> has
therefore been adjusted so that the debug infrastructure
can only modify the value of a register if the CPU has been fully halted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The flag indicating that the CPU is fully halted was not properly
implemented.  Specifically, the CPU might declare it was halted in the middle
of a CIS instruction when the second half of the instruction still needed
to be flushed through the pipeline.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="bugs-in-the-formal-properties">Bugs in the Formal Properties</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The formal properties within the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/core/zipcpu.v">core</a>,
as well as the abstracted components, are still quite immature.
Multiple bugs are still being found within them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/blob/master/rtl/ex/wbdblpriarb.v">Wishbone
arbiter</a>
had a careless assumption within it.  This prevented the arbiter from ever
being fully tested and verified.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a>
recognizes two memory regions: a local region for CPU-specific
peripherals from <code class="highlighter-rouge">0xff000000</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">0xffffffff</code> (used by the
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu/blob/master/rtl/zipsystem.v">ZipSystem</a>,
and a more global memory
region (everything else).  Crossing regions within the same memory operation
is a fault that needs to be prevented in software, and the formal
properties for describing this fault were <code class="highlighter-rouge">assert()</code> functions rather than
<code class="highlighter-rouge">restrict()</code> functions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="current-status">Current status</h2>

<p>I’m currently fully verifying the <a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a>’s
capability using an abstract prefetch, abstract divide, and an abstract
multiply.  Thanks to SymbiYosys and “abc pdr”, the properties I’ve now verified
constitutes a full formal proof (BMC + induction) of the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a>.</p>

<p>First, the formal properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve proven that the assumptions within all of the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a>’s
sub-modules hold.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve manage to verify that the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a>’s
pipeline logic won’t accidentally “delete” an instruction in the pipeline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve also managed to prove that the operands given to the
ALU, memory, or divide unit, are valid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following any ALU or divide instruction, only the correct register will
ever be written if at all–I haven’t dealt with predicates yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">BREAK</code> instructions never pass the OP stage as desired.  This makes certain
these instructions will not increment the PC when encountered.  This is
very similar to an illegal operand instruction, and the logic for these
may yet be merged.  For now, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">BREAK</code> instruction bypasses the ALU
stage of the CPU as desired.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I haven’t gotten to the cover properties yet, those are yet to come.</p>

<p>Here’s how far I’ve gotten:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Without pipelining the memory bus, the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a> made it for a full 40 clocks
in a bounded model check.  This was the extent of the test.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the pipelined memory bus, the
<a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a> has formally passed
<em>all of the formal properties</em> now written for it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The updated formal code is currently in a git repository branch that hasn’t
(yet) been pushed.  Feel free to contact me if you want more information
regarding this code.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I intend to update this page as I find more bugs, so that we can have a
full accounting of how many “bugs” formal methods might find in a “working”
CPU.  Once finished, the updated
<a href="/about/zipcpu.md">ZipCPU</a> code
will be pushed to its
<a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">github repository</a>.</p>
