# Welcome to the ZipCPU-Blog!

The files in this repository host the [ZipCPU blog](http://zipcpu.com) articles
via [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).

While you are welcome to browse these files via [Github's
interface](https://github.com/ZipCPU/website), I personally think you'll find
them much more interesting to look at from either the
web-site's [main page](http://zipcpu.com),
the [topics page](http://zipcpu.com/topics.html) which offers a categorical
list of past posts and future posts,
or the [about page](http://zipcpu.com/about/) which will tell you more about
[Gisselquist Technology](http://zipcpu.com/about/gisselquist-technology.html),
the [ZipCPU](http://zipcpu.com/about/zipcpu.html),
and other [projects/products](http://zipcpu.com/projects.html) that
[Gisselquist Technology](http://zipcpu.com/about/gisselquist-technology.html)
provides.
