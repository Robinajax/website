        <H1>Projects List</H1>

<div class="home">
Gisselquist Technology, LLC, has built a number of projects that may be of
value to you:
<UL>
<LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zipcpu">The ZipCPU</A></B>
	<P>A fully functional, fully pipelined, 32-bit CPU designed for
	resource constrained FPGA environments.  Although designed to be
	powerful enough to run Linux, a Linux port has not yet been written.
	Many of the projects that follow use this CPU.</P>
<LI>Zip CPU systems: The following are fully built, full featured systems for
	which the ZipCPU has been placed inside
  <UL>
  <LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</A></B>

	<P>This may be one of the most fully documented systems that uses the
	ZipCPU.  It's also a demonstration of how the ZipCPU can be made to fit
	on even the smallest of FPGA's.</P>
  <LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty">OpenArty</A></B>

	<P>This may be one of the most fully documented systems that uses the
	ZipCPU.  It's also a demonstration of how the ZipCPU can be made to fit
	on even the smallest of FPGA's.</P>
  <LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/xulalx25soc">XuLA2-LX25SoC</A></B>

	<P>While fully functional, this design isn't well documented.  It's
	unique because the debug access point to the device is run from the
	JTAG port, rather than a UART.  The system runs on on both the
	XuLA2-LX25 as well as the XuLA2-LX9.  Let me know if you would like to
	try this, and I'll help you get started.</P>
  <LI><B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/zbasic">ZipBasic</A></B>

	<P>This is a bare bones, minimal ZipCPU system.  If you wish to build
	a ZipCPU system and don't know where to start, this may be just
	the place.</A>
  <LI>One using the Basys3

	<P>Sorry, this project doesn't have a cool name.  It was my first
	FPGA project, and one from before I was working on open source projects.
	One unique feature of this one is that I drive the VGA port from the
	flash, and so this project can be used to display arbitrary presentation
	types of images on a VGA screen.</P>
  <LI>VideoZIP is another system I'm working on.  This one, though, is built
	automatically via the
	<B><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga">AutoFPGA</A></B>
	program.
  </UL></P>
<LI>Peripherals which may be used by the ZipCPU
	<P>Computer systems don't make much sense these days without
	peripherals, and the ZipCPU is no different.  The following is a
	truncated list of peripherals that have been used with the ZipCPU.</P>
  <UL>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbuart32">UART controller</A>
	<P>Contains both basic, and fully featured, serial port controllers</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbscope">Wishbone based scope</A>

	<P>This plus the UART to wishbone bus converter I have might easily be
	considered the crown jewels of Gisselquist Technology.  Using this
	wishbone scope, I have debugged many, many interfaces--some listed
	here.  I would recommend it for anyone interested in incorporating a
	scope into one of their projects.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="http://opencores.org/project,qspiflash">QSPI Flash controller</A>

	<P>A basic QSPI based flash controller.  I've used this controller on
	almost all of my projects, although many of the projects use subtly
	different versions of it.  For example, the smallest and fastest
	flash controller is the <A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc/blob/master/rtl/qflashxpress.v">read only controller</A> used in the
 	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/s6soc">S6SoC</A> project.
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/enetpackets.v">I2C Controller</A>

	<P>A full featured RMII network packet interface, contained within the
	OpenArty distribution.  Also within the distribution is a demonstration
	<A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/sw/board/simple_ping.c">"ping" program</A> for the ZipCPU.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbi2c">I2C Controller</A>

	<P>This I2C controller has demonstrated itself via the ability to read
	and write EDID display information as part of an HDMI project.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpwmaudio">PWM Audio Controller</A>
  <LI>GPS schooled clock
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/rtcclock">RTC Clock</A>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SDSPI SD-card controller</A>

	<P>In order to use the SD Card on the XuLA board, I needed a SPI
	based SD-Card controller.  While I intend to upgrade this to SDIO in
	the future, the SPI based controller is still valuable</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/fmtxhack">FM transmitter hack</A>

	<P>Must to prove FPGA's are in no ways inferior to
	<A HREF="https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/raspberry-pi-fm-transmitter/">Raspberry
	PI's</A>, this peripheral can be used to turn your GPIO pins into an
	ad-hoc FM transmitter on commercial (US) frequencies.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbpmic">WBPMIC</A>

	<P>A very simple controller designed to read from <A HREF="http://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</A>'s
	<A HREF="store.digilentinc.com/pmod-mic3-mems-microphone-with-adjustable-gain/">MEMs microphone PMod</A>.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/openarty/blob/master/rtl/wboled.v">WB
	Oled</A>, a controller for the
	<A HREF="http://store.digilentinc.com">Digilent</A>
	<A HREF="http://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-oledrgb-96-x-64-rgb-oled-display-with-16-bit-color-resolution/">PMod OLEDrgb</A> display

	<P>Xilinx's internal configuration access port provides some very
	useful features.  Getting it running initially, though, was a touch
	of a challenge.  This project captures what it takes in a Wishbone
	peripheral format.</P>
  <LI><A HREF="https://github.com/ZipCPU/wbicapetwo">ICAPE Interface</A>

	<P>Xilinx's internal configuration access port provides some very
	useful features.  Getting it running initially, though, was a touch
	of a challenge.  This project captures what it takes in a Wishbone
	peripheral format.</P>
  </UL>
<LI>Projects that are not posted
	<P>I am a businessman after all, and Gisselquist Technology, LLC, is
	in the business of making money.  Hence, the following two projects
	are available for sale to anyone interested.
  <UL>
  <LI>High resolution frequency analyzer and synthesizer
	<P>We'll discuss this more on this forum as time goes by.  For now,
	the information on the
	<A HREF="/dsp/freq-teaser.html">teaser page</A>
	should be sufficient to gather some interest.</P>
  <LI>Universal resampler
	<P>Given any signal into your FPGA, at up to the speed of the
	controller (100MHz), downsample that signal to any desired rate with
	32-bit fractional precision.  Alternatively, if you want to upsample,
	you can upsample your signal and then use this universal resampler to
	come down to the rate you would like.</P>
	<P>What makes this project unique from other resamplers you might use
	or build is that the aliasing products from the arbitrary resampler
	are within a -70dB stop band, making this a high quality resampler.
  <LI>GPS processor
  </UL>
</UL>

<P>Most of my projects have been released under the
<A HREF="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPLv3 license</A>.  They may be
built with <A HREF="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</A>
without violating this license.  Indeed, the license allows you to build
your own projects using these components.  Sadly, going beyond that limit gets
into a legally gray area at this time.  I would ask, therefore, that if you
wish to publish or distribute this code as part of your own project, that you
contact me for a more appropriate license.  Hence, if you find this license
insufficient for your needs, please contact me and I'll be glad to sell you a
proprietary license customized to meet your needs.
