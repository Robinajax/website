<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
Welcome to three dimensional tic-tac-toe.  This game is played just
like normal tic-tac-toe with two exceptions.  The first is that there
are four squares to each side.  To win you need to get four in a row,
not just three.  The second is that this game is in three dimensions.
There are four planes to this board that can be played like normal
two dimensional tic-tac-toe.  Unlike normal tic-tac-toe, however,
one does not need to get four in a row on a single plane.
A valid win can go through the planes in a straight vertical
or diagonal manner.

<p>If you are unclear about how this might work, try playing the game
at it's <strong>Random</strong> setting until you are more 
comfortable.  Try winning in a straight vertical line by moving into
the same square on all four planes.  Try a diagonal line by picking a 
corner on the top and bottom planes and taking the pieces in between.
Try another diagonal from a side on the top plane to the opposite
side on the bottom.

<p>When you are ready, your computer would like to challenge
you to a game.

<h2 align=center>Rules</h2>
<hr width=75%>
<p>You are <font size=+2 color="#0000aa">X</font> and <em>you start!</em>
<p>To <strong>move</strong> click in any open square.
<p>To <strong>win</strong> you need to get four in a row.  These can be horizontal,
vertical, diagonal, or even through the planes of the board in some 
three dimensional line.
Beware--the three dimensional combinations may be difficult to for you and I to
visualize, but they are not so difficult for the computer.

<h2>User Controls</h2>
<p>Two user controls are available.
<p>The <strong>New</strong> button starts a new game.
<p>The <strong>Hints</strong> control 
determines whether or not hints are shown.  If hints are shown, 
they appear as dark squares underneath the pieces on the board.
These dark squares hilite all of the <em>still-valid</em> four 
in a rows through wherever the mouse is <font color=orange>pointed</font>.
A four in a row is considered <em>still-valid</em> if either it 
is empty or it contains only
<font size=+2 color="#0000aa">X</font>'s, 
or only <font size=+2 color="#dd0000">O</font>'s.
<p>The <strong>Difficulty</strong> control determines how 
intelligent your opponent will be.
Specifically, it determines how many rules your opponent uses to select his move.  The
more rules, the tougher he will be.
